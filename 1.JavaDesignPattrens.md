## Java Design Patterns


## What are Design Patterns?

- 	Identify Recurring problems 
-	Provide ready to use solutions
-	Three imp terms: Problem, solution, Context

## Gang of Four Pattern

-	4 Guys have  written a book called Elements of Reusable Object Oriented S/w


## Why Design Patterns?

-	Capture Design Experience
-	Promote reuse without having to reinvent the wheel
-	Define the system structure better
-	Provide a common design language

## Pattern Identification

-	When we encounter with problem: 
	-	We will check whether is solution is already available, if there we will reuse them
	-	If there are solutions already available:
		-	We will document the problem with the solution following a pattern template
		-	Initially it will called as candidate pattern
	
	-	If Problem is recurring applications or across different projects
	-	We will check whether candidate pattern solves the issue
	-	If it solves,then solution will be written to Pattern catalog
	-	Then candidate pattern will become design pattern
	
## Pattern Catalog

-	 Based the problem that pattern solves, Patterns are divided into multiple categories
-	There 2 types of patterns :

	-	Core Pattern or Gang of Four Pattern
	-	JEE Pattern for Enterprise applications
	
	-	Core Pattern is divided into
		
		-	Creational Pattern
			-	Deals with Object Creation
				-	Factory 
				-	Singleton
				-	Abstract Factory
				-	Builder 
				-	Prototype
				
		-	Structural Pattern
			-	Deals with relationship b/w Classes
				
				-	Adapter
				-	Bridge
				-	Flyweight
				-	Decorator
				-	Proxy
				
				
		-	Behavioral Pattern
			-	Deals with communication b/w Objects and Classes
	
				-	Command 
				- 	Interpreter
				-	Template Method
				-	Observer
	
## JEE Pattern Catalog

-	Every Java application is logically divided into multiple layers
	-	Presentation Layer
	-	Business Layer
	-	Service Layer
	-	Integration Layer
	-	Data Access Layer
-	JEE Patterns are categorized based on these layers

	-	Presentation Layer
		
		-	Front Controller
		-	Intercepting Filter
		-	MVC
		-	Context Object
		
	-	Business Layer
		
		-	Business Delegate
		-	Transfer Object
		-	Session Facade
		- 	Service Locater
		
	-	Data Access Layer
		
		-	Data Access Object Pattern
	
	- 	Integration Layer
	
		-	Service Activator
